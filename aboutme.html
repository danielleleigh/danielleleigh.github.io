          Leaving High School, I had no idea what I wanted to do in life. I
          joined the military in February of 2009, as an Aviation Ordnanceman
          doing bomb assembly. Upon exiting the military, I enrolled in college
          for a degree in Chemistry. After switching my degree path 2-3 times, I
          settled on Sociology, and obtained my degree in 2020. <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          Unfortunately, I quickly realized that Sociology and Social Work
          weren't for me and within a year of graduating I was searching for
          something new. Throughout my search, my sister constantly reminded me
          of how she believe I'd be great at development, especially since she
          knows I absolutely LOVED coding people's Myspace pages back in the
          day. In September of 2021, I enrolled in a HTML/CSS basics course and
          shortly after I was approved for the VA's VRRAP program, and shortly
          after I enrolled in DevCodeCamp. Now, upon completion of this program,
          I will be Full Stack Developer!
